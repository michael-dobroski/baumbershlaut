    <h2>How to Play Baumbershlaut</h2>
    <img src="Untitled.png" alt="how to play" width="275" height="200">
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>- 6-8 players gather in a circle like in the figure above</p>
        <p>- The game will be played in single-elimination rounds</p>
        <p>- Line chairs againt a wall, with the number of chairs being equivalent to the number of players minus one</p>
        <p>- On the adjacent side, there will be some boundary, marked by a physical item i.e. broom or dry erase marker, the light blue line above represents where the boundary should be in accordance with the wall of chairs</p>
        <p>- Before starting a round, someone taps the new category button at the top of this page to chose a category for that round</p>
        <p>- Players go clockwise and when they step over the boundary, they must say something in that given category</p>
        <p>- If someone passes the boundary without saying anything or repeats an answer, everyone screams BAUMBERSHLAUT!!!!!!!!</p>
        <p>- This initiates the Baumbershlaut phase. Players must make it to a chair and sit in it. But, you can also try to grab the ball in the middle</p>
        <p>- If any player is hit by the ball, they are out for that round. Otherwise, if no one is hit, the person who doesn't find a chair is out.</p>
        <p>- If a player catches the ball, the person who threw it goes out instead</p>
        <p>- Rounds repeat until there is one player remaining. They are hereby declared the Baumbershlaut Daddy and are looked down upon for the rest of their pathetic lives.</p>
